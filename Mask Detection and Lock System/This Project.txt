I decided to make a program which recognises mask and unlocks a lock earlier for some national webinar or something to be conducted by 
Robotics club of VIT Bhopal.
I used these videos as the major source for the code :

This one for mask detection

This one for integrating with lock in arduino.
I took a look into the possibility of taking the second one completely, but it needed tensorflow and keras. Even though I downloaded Keras
as well as the other, the later further required drivers, and other stuff(refer official site in google for tenserflow). So I decided the
current way.

I came to a problem of bad assignment in detectMultiScale and finally after sometime realised I had given wrong input that is videocapture(0)
instead of the img extracted from it.
Edit (3rd Aug 2023) : While I was having the same issue, the problem was that the "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" file was missing. Just place it in the same directory 


Then I came to a new problem of "[ WARN:0@10.497] global D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\videoio\src\cap_msmf.cpp (539) `anonymous-namespace'::SourceReaderCB::~SourceReaderCB terminating async callback"
and my images was not saving into the file.
I found this in stack overflow :
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53888878/cv2-warn0-terminating-async-callback-when-attempting-to-take-a-picture
But then I realised that it was saving in a directory two steps back(python folder in programming)
So the two .npy files for with and without masks is now in Robotics folder(also in working folder but no use)

Now, for the machine learning model scikit learn is downloaded as is used.

UPDATE (3rd Aug 2023)

I tried looking everywhere for the Main.py file which is the file which detects the mask/no mask (main file) but was nowhere to be found. Ultimately using this same text file I got the youtube video I used for making this. I searched the source code with the company's name in google and got into their github profile. Then I surfed through their repos and finally found the Mask Detection repo where the code which I needed was there. 

Here is the github repo : https://github.com/sheisol310/Mask-Detection/blob/main/Detect%20Mask.py
